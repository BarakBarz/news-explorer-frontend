          Hi, i'm Barak Barzilay, Web Developer. With a found passion for

          I learned all this through Masterschool and practicum's Web Dev
          course. This web application here is my final project that
          incorporates everything i've learned, together with site deployment.
          In the nine months course, we sprinted through a lot of material. The
          course was simulated in agile methodology, in order to get a feel of
          working in a tech company.
        </p>

          I am currently learning more tech and how to implement it better and
          staying up at night in bed thinking about bugs. ðŸª²
